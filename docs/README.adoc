=== Steps to test AAP 2 on Ansible Advanced - Lab CI (Test Env)

. You can install ansible-core and and ansible-navigator on bastion as follows.
+
[source,text]
----
$ sudo yum install ansible-core ansible-navigator -y
----

. Test pinging all of the hosts using ansible-navigator.
+
[source,text]
----
$ cat > $HOME/ping.yml <<EOF
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - ping:
EOF
----

. You need to perform image registry authenication before you run ansible-navigator.
+
[source,text]
----
$ podman login -u your_email_id@redhat.com registry.redhat.io
password: <enter your password>
----

. Execute ansible-navigate as follows. 
+
[source,text]
----
$ ansible-navigator run  ping.yml -i /etc/ansible/hosts -u cloud-user -e ansible_ssh_private_key_file=.ssh/${GUID}key.pem
----


=== Test AAP 2 with Multitier deployment.

. Clone Multitier Application from following git repository on bastion.
+
[source,text]
----
$ cd $HOME
$ git clone https://github.com/tonykay/multi-tier-app-deployer.git
$ cd multi-tier-app-deployer
----

. Copy inventory file in repository directory as follows. 
+
[source,text]
----
$ cp /etc/ansible/hosts .
----


. Replace ansible.cfg file in cloned repository with following content as follows.
+
[source,text]
----
$ cat > ansible.cfg <<EOF
[defaults]
inventory               = hosts
remote_user             = cloud-user
private_key_file        = .ssh/${GUID}key.pem

EOF
----

. Now copy `$HOME/.ssh` directory in the git cloned repository as follows.
+
[source,text]
----
$ cp -r $HOME/.ssh .
----

. Install collection in current directory as follows.
+
[source,text]
----
$ ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml -p collections
----

. Perform image registry authenication before you can run ansible-navigator.
+
[source,text]
----
$ podman login -u your_email_id@redhat.com registry.redhat.io
password: <enter your password>
----

. You can now execute multtier deploy-app.yml playbook with ansible-navigator as follows.
+
[source,text]
----
$ ansible-navigator -m stdout run deploy-app.yml
----


. You can also test teardown-app.yml as follows.
+
[source,text]
----
$ ansible-navigator -m stdout run teardown-app.yml
----
